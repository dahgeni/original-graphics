                            <p>Sheila McDaniel is a photographer whose work explores stereotypes of race and gender, most often with an emphasis on African American women.

My signature technique is photo-text, which involves including brief passages of text superimposed on her photographs, introducing new levels of meaning to the images. My photography typically explores the perception of African American women in American culture, and in 2007 my work was featured in a 20-year retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art.</p>

“Photography is my muse, my profession, and the thing that will undoubtedly drive me insane someday.

I don’t photograph things. I photograph the way they make me feel. Admittedly, it’s a bit of a strange concept. But it’s honest – and it’s the best way to describe my approach to the craft.</p>
